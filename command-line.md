The command line is a way to interact with the computer directly by talking to it using text, rather than with using the mouse to click buttons.

Ten common terminal commands:

cd = change which folder you're in

ls = list all the files in the current folder

pwd = shows the location of the folder you're in

mkdir = create a new subfolder

date = shows the current date and time

cal = displays calendar

df = shows how much free disk space there is

whoami = displays your username

rm = remove a file

cp = copy a file
